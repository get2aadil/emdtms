EMDTMS stands for "E-Milk Delivery and Transport Management System."

Many trucking companies still rely on paperwork, which makes it tricky to track their profits accurately. Factors like distance traveled, maintenance costs, routes taken, and driver fees all play a role. Without proper tracking, it's tough for companies to plan effectively and maximize profits.

Our solution? We've developed a system that generates detailed expense reports for each truck. These reports include maintenance and fuel costs, along with route and driver information. This helps companies stay on top of their expenses and make informed decisions.

Additionally, our system features CRUD functionality for easy data management, as well as login and forget password functionalities for enhanced security.
